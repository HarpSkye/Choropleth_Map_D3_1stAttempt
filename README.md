# Choropleth_Map_D3_1stAttempt
### Description
<p>This map is inspired by <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map>freeCodeCamp Choropleth Plot</a>. You can also find the map at my <a href=https://codepen.io/harpskye/pen/xxJzbJZ?editors=0010>codepen</a></p> Or, you can find the map from <a href=https://harpskye.github.io/Choropleth_Map_D3_1stAttempt/>here</a>


### Peronal Challenges & obstacles
<p>Challenges that I have faced:</p>
<ul>
<li> for...in VS for...of</li>
<li> connect two different data sets for the first time</li>
<li> show basic US map</li>
<li> different properties displayed in .attr() and .on() </li>
<li>.currentTarget.__data__</li>
<li> flexbox on top of flexbox</li>

</ul>

### Future Improvements
<p>Here are a few things that I would like to followup in the near future: </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to build the map to show the 25% sales of each state in USA. In this case, each state will show up with their individual heatmap, while the filter will be provided to help select the state that viewers prefer. </li>
<li>Join two dataset together extremely intrigued me, since the procedure of JS to do so is very different from what I have been doing as a data scientist. This difference actually helping me to understand my logic in deeper level. </li>
</ul>
